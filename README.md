It's a React demo project I created from 0 for practice.
Now it containes only one page - Customer Search.

Techniques:
Front-end: React, Redux
UI Framework: Material UI
Development Server: webpack-dev-server
Nodejs Server: Koa
Database: MongoDB

Plan:
1. Add more features about React, such as router, propType.
2. Add Unit tests for React and Koa.
3. Fix defects.
Refactor all the time.
